Pands Project 
*** 

 
This project is about an analysis and exploring the Iris dataset from this webpage (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)  

 
The flour named "iris" has a lot of kinds of species. It is a popular garden flower. 

"Three Iris varieties are used in the Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936." 

This dataset describe as: 

Attribute Information: 

   -> sepal length in cm 

   -> sepal width in cm 

   -> petal length in cm 

   -> petal width in cm 

   -> class:  

              Iris Setosa 

              Iris Versicolor 

              Iris Virginica 

 

Number of Instances: 150  

 
It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. 

Some source who analyzes the dataset said that the algorithm is the best way for Iris dataset.  

The results show that the performance of the decision tree classifier algorithm is the most outperformed on the Iris dataset. (https://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE/article/view/33889/17273)  

To analyze this dataset, I used python 3.11, VSC, jupyter and GitHub. 

In the project repositories have five (5) files, and which file is about a part of the project. That I will explain introduce all of them here. 

>analysis.py - is a repository where all the analysis of the iris dataset is using python. 

>gitignore - is a repository where I used to ignore all non-necessity for this project. 

>iris.dataset.csv - here is where all dataset is in CSV version. 

>iris.data - here is where I had downloaded all the dataset version from the website. 

>irisdataset.ipynb - here is my notebook where I have explained all my analysis and pass to pass of this project. Including the references I had used.

I was a nurse for the last 23y, after the covid and my son I decided to change my career to IT, and I started studying IT last year. I never thought I would be doing what I am doing now. It is a big challenge for me but change work with humans for machine. But in the end, I am happy that I'm learning a lot of things.
